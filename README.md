# Asgard

*Exploring the German language*


## Introduction

**Asgard** is actually *a set* of open source projects dedicated to exploring the German language in detail:

* The most user-friendly subproject is [Farbiges Deutsch](http://gianlucacosta.info/FarbigesDeutsch/), showing German rules as well as *inferred statistical data* in a colorful and effective way

* [Balmung](https://github.com/giancosta86/Balmung) is the basic library supporting the architecture, modeling the main German word categories

* [Odin](https://github.com/giancosta86/Odin) is the core library of the project, providing a Hibernate-based repository for German lemmas, as well as a Wiktionary parser

* [Valkyrie](https://github.com/giancosta86/Valkyrie) is an experimental Scala application creating the data flowing into Farbiges Deutsch

I plan to use these tools to learn even more about German - and I hope you'll find them useful, too! ^\_\_^!
